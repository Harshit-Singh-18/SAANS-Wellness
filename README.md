Wellness Survey Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the wellness of individuals based on various dimensions such as Physical, Nutritional, Emotional, and more. The analysis was conducted by curating a questionnaire, collecting primary qualitative data, converting it into quantitative data using Likert and VA scales, and then performing statistical analysis to identify individuals in need of intervention. The project also includes a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize the data distribution and trends.

Key Features
Data Collection: A structured survey was employed to collect primary qualitative data using a curated questionnaire.
Data Conversion: Utilized Likert Scale and VA Scale to convert qualitative data into quantitative form, enabling the identification of individuals requiring aid.
Statistical Analysis:
Applied t-statistic to segregate the data based on gender differences.
Used ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to examine wellness variations across different age groups and geographic locations.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Created bar plots, box plots, and histograms to visualize the distribution of wellness dimensions.
Calculated a composite wellness score for each participant based on ten wellness dimensions.
Wellness Dimensions Analyzed
Physical Wellness
Nutritional Wellness
Emotional Wellness
Career and Financial Wellness
Intellectual Wellness
Environmental Wellness
Social Wellness
Cosmic Wellness
Data Analysis Process
Data Preparation: The data collected via the questionnaire was structured and converted into a suitable format for analysis.
Wellness Score Calculation: Each participant's wellness score was calculated by summing their scores across the different wellness dimensions.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Bar plots, box plots, and histograms were created for each wellness dimension.
Statistical Testing:
A t-test was performed to compare wellness scores between male and female participants.
ANOVA was conducted to investigate wellness score variations across different cities.
Tools & Libraries Used
R Programming Language: For data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization.
dplyr: For data wrangling and manipulation.
ggplot2: For creating visualizations such as bar plots, box plots, and histograms.
Project Output
The statistical results, including t-test and ANOVA, help in understanding the wellness disparities based on gender, age, and geography.
The visualizations provide insights into the distribution and central tendencies of wellness scores across different dimensions.
An updated dataset with a calculated wellness score for each participant was generated.
